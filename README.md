# ML_Capstone_Insurance
This is a capstone project on auto insurance and finding the customer life time value with proper eda and prediction score.

in this project first the necessary librarier were imported into the jupyter notebook, than the data set is imported
into the variable, after inmporting the data set data was cleaned and organized as per the project need.

further, after preprocessing and cleaning the data EDA- Exploratory Data Analysis was performed with the univariate - 
Categorical and Numerical Analysis as per different features and then bivariate analysis was done, for doing
eda we have used mixture of charts and plots like - count plot, pie plot, bar plot, hist plot, scatter plot and many more.

After, performing eda we have moved forward to model building for that first we have split our data inti train and test data.
then we have fir the train data into different models like- linear regression, decission tree, random forest, bagging and many more,
but, after performing the best score which we could get was from Random forest and Bagging algorithms.
